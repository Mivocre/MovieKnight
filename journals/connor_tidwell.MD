-   Added the first draft of our front-end API documentation
-   Tested merge requests
-   Created multiple issue logs specifying features from our wireframe

Today I created a new branch and exported the first draft of our front-end API documentation into a new file named frontend-API-documentation.md. With this new file, I learned how to properly make a merge request to main (auto deleted branch after completion of merge / no squashing). I also created three (3) issues in which each define specific features of our project that all include user stories, features, acceptance criteria, and definition of done (DoD).
